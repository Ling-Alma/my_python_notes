# PYTHON BASICS

# Comments: The hashtag makes the rest of the line a comment.
# The more programming you do, the more you focus on making good comments.

# Assign some text (a string) to a variable
some_text = 'This is the text.'
other_text = "Could also use double-quotes too."

# Assign some numbers to variables
a = 5  # Here, we implicitly told python that a is an integer
b = 4.6  # Here, we told python that b is a floating point number (a decimal)

# Python as a calculator. Notice that it can add the integer and the float. Python "smartly" redefines variables so that they work together.
# This is different from other languages which require you to manually manage the "types" of your variables.
sum_of_two_numbers = a + b

# Printing output to the console
print('Our output was', sum_of_two_numbers) # You may see print output in some cases, but this is dated code.

# At this point, run the script (SHIFT F10).
